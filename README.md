# component-from-stream on steroids (1.2k bytes gzip)
[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/component-from-stream.png?compact=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/component-from-stream/)

create a React-like component from any React-compatible library,
that sources its props from an observable stream.

backwards-compatible with, and based on [`component-from-stream`](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose/blob/master/docs/API.md#componentfromstream)
from [`recompose`](https://npmjs.com/package/recompose),
with the following enhancements:
* compatible with any [`React`](https://reactjs.org)-compatible library,<br/>
so long as it provides a [`React`](https://reactjs.org)-like `Component` class,
e.g. [`PREACT`](https://preactjs.com/) or [`Inferno`](https://infernojs.org/).
* support for operators that may dispatch back into source stream,<br/>
e.g. [`component-from-stream-redux`](https://npmjs.com/package/component-from-stream-redux).<br/>
more info in the [API section](#API).
* support for a custom `props` dispatcher instead of the default dispatcher,<br/>
e.g. to emit [FSAs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/flux-standard-action)
into the [`component-from-stream-redux`](https://npmjs.com/package/component-from-stream-redux) operator.
* shorthand support for separation of view from reactive behaviour (see below).
* life-cycle management and gated rendering from within
the component's reactive behaviour:
  * automatically complete on `componentWillUnmount`.
  * only render when the reactive operator emits a `props` object,<br/>
and render null on falsy values.

compatible with observable libraries such as [`RxJS`](http://reactivex.io/rxjs/)
or [`MOST`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/most)

# <a name="example"></a> Example: separation of view from reactive behaviour
see the full [example](./example/index.tsx) in this directory.<br/>
run the example in your browser locally with `npm run example`
or [online here](https://cdn.rawgit.com/ZenyWay/component-from-stream/v0.17.0/example/index.html).

the [`component-from-stream` example](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose/blob/master/docs/API.md#componentfromstream)
from `recompose` can be refactored as follows
to separate view rendering from reactive behaviour:
```jsx
const Counter = componentFromStream(pipe(newCounterOperator(), map(render)))

function render({ count, onClickIncrement, onClickDecrement, ...attrs }) {
  return (
    <pre {...attrs}>
      Count: {count}
      <button onClick={onClickIncrement}><b>+</b></button>
      <button onClick={onClickDecrement}><b>-</b></button>
    </pre>
  )
}

function newCounterOperator () {
  const diff$ = new Subject()
  const onClickIncrement = () => diff$.next(1)
  const onClickDecrement = () => diff$.next(-1)

  const count$ = diff$.pipe(
    startWith(0),
    scan((count, n) => count + n, 0)
  )

  return pipe(
    combineLatest(count$),
    map(([ props, count ]) => ({
      count,
      onClickIncrement,
      onClickDecrement,
      ...props
    }))
  )
}

function pipe (...operators) {
  return function (q$) {
    return q$.pipe(...operators)
  }
}
```
this module supports the following shorthand for this approach:
```ts
const Counter = componentFromStream(render, newCounterOperator)
```

separation of reactive behaviour from view rendering yields a number of advantages:
* behaviours are independent of rendering framework:
view rendering functions may easily be replaced.
* state can typically be confined to within a small subset
of composable reactive behaviours.
* unit behaviours can be shared between components.
* a component's behaviour can be extended by composing it
with additional unit behaviours.
* simpler unit testing:
  * stateless view rendering functions can easily be tested separately
  (e.g. with [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/))
  * behaviours operate exclusively within streams of `props` = no DOM involved.
  * unit testing effort can focus on stateful unit behaviours,
  stateless behaviours being straightforward to validate.
* a component's behaviour typically becomes self-documenting.

# <a name="API"></a>API: three `component-from-stream` factory signatures
<!-- ![component-from-stream diagram](./component-from-stream.svg) -->

the `component-from-stream` factory is not directly exposed by this module.<br/>
instead, a higher-level factory is exposed for injecting the following dependencies:
* the base `Component` from a [`React`](https://reactjs.org)-like library,
e.g. [`PREACT`](https://preactjs.com/) or [`Inferno`](https://infernojs.org/).
* Observable conversion functions for reactive operator support
from third-party Observable libraries, e.g. [`RxJS`](http://reactivex.io/rxjs/)
or [`MOST`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/most).

this higher-level factory returns the required component factory
after injection of the supplied dependencies.
it is typically only required once in a project,
the resulting `component-from-stream` factory being exposed to the project's
other modules:
```js
import createComponentFromStreamFactory from 'component-from-stream'
import { Component } from 'inferno'
import { from } from 'rxjs'

// component-from-stream factory based on Inferno and RxJS
export default createComponentFromStreamFactory(Component, from)
```

in addition to the [original `component-from-stream` factory signature](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose/blob/master/docs/API.md#componentfromstream)
from [`recompose`](https://npmjs.com/package/recompose),
the [example from the previous section](#example) illustrates
the additional dual-argument signature,
shorthand for separating view and reactive operator behaviour.

in this example, the reactive operator factory ignores its arguments.
however, that factory is nonetheless called with a number of arguments,
as detailed in the `OperatorFactory` type declaration below.
the first of these arguments is a `StreamableDispatcher` object,
which provides hooks into the internal dispatching mechanism.
this allows for more complex feedback control of the reactive operator chain.

this is most useful with the `component-from-stream` factory's third signature,
which takes at least three arguments
as specified in the `ComponentFromStreamFactory` interface declaration below.
in this configuration,
* the second argument is a projection function,
which maps the incoming props to any object before being dispatched into
the component's reactive operator.
* all remaining arguments are `OperatorFactory` factories.
the operators instantiated by these factories are composed from left to right
to generate the component's reactive operator,
that maps the dispatched objects to view props.

see the [`component-from-stream-redux`](https://npmjs.com/package/component-from-stream-redux)
module for an example implementation of this extended signature.

# `Symbol.observable`
This module expects `Symbol.observable` to be defined in the global scope.
Use a polyfill such as [`symbol-observable`](https://npmjs.com/package/symbol-observable/)
and if necessary a `Symbol` polyfill.
Check the [`symbol-observable-polyfill` script](./package.json#L10)
for an example of how to generate the standalone polyfill,
which can than be [loaded from a script tag](./example/index.html#L27),
or simply add `import 'symbol-observable'` at the top of your project's main file.

# TypeScript
although this library is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org),
it may also be imported into plain JavaScript code:
modern code editors will still benefit from the available type definition,
e.g. for helpful code completion.
