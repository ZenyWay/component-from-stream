# component-from-stream on steroids
[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/component-from-stream.png?compact=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/component-from-stream/)

create a React-like component that sources its props from an observable stream
and supports middleware.
based on [component-from-stream](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose/blob/master/docs/API.md#componentfromstream)
from [recompose](https://npmjs.com/package/recompose),
with the following enhancements:
* compatible with any [`React`](https://reactjs.org)-like framework,
so long as it provides a [`React`](https://reactjs.org)-like `Component` class,<br/>
e.g. [`PREACT`](https://preactjs.com/) or [`Inferno`](https://infernojs.org/).
* [separation](#separation) of stateless view from stateful reactive behaviour.
* life-cycle management and gated rendering from within
the component's reactive behaviour:
  * automatically complete on `componentWillUnmount`.
  * only render when the reactive operator emits a `props` object,<br/>
and render null on falsy values.
* support for a custom `props` dispatcher instead of the default dispatcher,<br/>
i.e. customize what the stream emits.
* supports any number of middleware in the dispatching path.
more info in the [API section](#API).

compatible with observable libraries such as [`RxJS`](http://reactivex.io/rxjs/)
or [`MOST`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/most)

# <a name="separation"></a> Separation of stateless view from stateful behaviour
the stateless rendering function (the component's view) is separated
from the potentially stateful reactive operator (the component's behaviour)
which maps the component's input stream of `props` to that of its rendering function.

Separation of behaviour from view has many advantages, among which:
* state can typically be confined to within a small subset of behaviours.
* views can be stateless and easily tested separately (e.g. with [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/))
* straightforward unit testing:
  * behaviours operate exclusively within streams of `props` = no DOM involved.
  * unit testing effort can focus on stateful unit behaviours,
  stateless behaviours being straightforward to validate.
* a component's behaviour typically becomes self-documenting.
* behaviours are independent of rendering framework.
* unit behaviours can be shared between components.
* for a given view, an existing component's behaviour can be extended
by composing it with additional unit behaviours.

# Example
see the full [example](./example/index.tsx) in this directory.
run the example in your browser locally with `npm run example`
or [online here](https://cdn.rawgit.com/ZenyWay/component-from-stream/v0.12.0/example/index.html).

this example demonstrates how to implement `component-from-stream` Components
described in terms of their view and composed behaviour:

`component-from-stream.ts`
```ts
import createComponentFromStreamFactory, {
  ComponentFromStreamFactory, ComponentFromStreamConstructor
} from '../src'
import { InfernoChildren, Component } from 'inferno'
import { from } from 'rxjs'

export { ComponentFromStreamFactory, ComponentFromStreamConstructor, Component, InfernoChildren }

// export a component-from-stream factory based on Inferno and RxJS
export default createComponentFromStreamFactory<Component<any,any>,InfernoChildren>(
  Component,
  from
)
```

`copy-button/index.ts`
```ts
import Button from './view'
import copyButtonBehaviour from './behaviour'
import componentFromStream, {
  ComponentFromStreamConstructor, Component, InfernoChildren
} from '../component-from-stream'

export default componentFromStream(Button, copyButtonBehaviour)
```

`copy-button/behaviour.ts`
```ts
import { shallowEqual, shallowMerge, pick, log } from '../utils'
import compose from 'basic-compose'
import { into } from 'basic-cursors'
import withEventHandler from 'rx-with-event-handler'
import { distinctUntilChanged, map, tap } from 'rxjs/operators'

export default compose(
  tap(log('copy-button:view-props:')),
  distinctUntilChanged(shallowEqual), // only render when necessary
  map(into('icon')(iconFromDisabled)),
  pickDistinct('disabled', 'onClick', 'icons'), // clean-up
  withToggleDisabledOnSuccess,
  withEventHandler('click')(map(into('success')(doCopyToClipboard))),
  map(shallowMerge(DEFAULT_PROPS)) // icons are not deep-copied
)

function doCopyToClipboard({ event, value }) {
  event.payload.preventDefault()
  return copyToClipboard(value) //true on success
}

function pickDistinct(...keys) {
  return compose(distinctUntilChanged(shallowEqual), map(pick(...keys)))
}

function iconFromDisabled ({ disabled, icons }: any) {
  return disabled ? icons.disabled : icons.enabled
}
// ...
```
each argument supplied to the above `compose` function is a reactive operator
which implements a specific unit behaviour by generating an output stream
of `props` from an input stream of `props`.

the unit behaviours are composed from bottom to top:
`props` are processed from outside to inside,
i.e. from component `props` to view `props`.

e.g. `withEventHandler('click')` from [`rx-with-event-handler`](https://npmjs.com/package/rx-with-event-handler/)
adds an `onClick` prop and emits the extended `props` object
whenever it receives a new input.
whenever the `onClick` handler is called (from the rendered `Component`),
it also adds an `event` prop to the emitted `props` object,
and pipes the latter through the given event handler operator,
in this case `map(into('success')(doCopyToClipboard))`,
which copies the `value` prop to the clipboard
and sets a `success` prop to `true` on success, `false` otherwise.

the resulting event can then be further processed by a downstream operator,
e.g. `withToggleDisabledOnSuccess`, which toggles the boolean `disabled` prop
for a brief moment whenever the `success` prop turns `true`.
[check the code](./example/copy-button/behaviour.ts#L64-L75)
for implementation details of this operator.

# <a name="API"></a>API
the `component-from-stream` factory is not directly exposed by this module.<br/>
instead, a higher-level factory is exposed for injecting the following dependencies:
* the base `Component` from a [`React`](https://reactjs.org)-like library,
e.g. [`PREACT`](https://preactjs.com/) or [`Inferno`](https://infernojs.org/).
* Observable conversion functions for reactive operator support
from third-party Observable libraries, e.g. [`RxJS`](http://reactivex.io/rxjs/)
or [`MOST`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/most).

this higher-level factory returns the required component factory
after injection of the supplied dependencies.
it is typically only required once in a project,
the resulting `component-from-stream` factory being exposed to the project's
other modules.

the above example illustrates the traditional instatiation of a `component-from-stream`,
with a reactive operator that maps incoming props to view props.

the component factory may however be given additional optional arguments,
for structuring more complex behaviours into self-documenting code:
* `onprops` dispatcher factory: a factory that returns a custom props dispatcher,
e.g. to add default props, event handlers,
and/or to dispatch an [FSA](https://www.npmjs.com/package/flux-standard-action)
object with props as payload.
* `...middlewares`: rest arguments are middleware for dispatching.

# `Symbol.observable`
This module expects `Symbol.observable` to be defined in the global scope.
Use a polyfill such as [`symbol-observable`](https://npmjs.com/package/symbol-observable/)
and if necessary a `Symbol` polyfill.
Check the [`symbol-observable-polyfill` script](./package.json#L10)
for an example of how to generate the standalone polyfill,
which can than be [loaded from a script tag](./example/index.html#L27),
or simply add `import 'symbol-observable'` at the top of your project's main file.

# TypeScript
although this library is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org),
it may also be imported into plain JavaScript code:
modern code editors will still benefit from the available type definition,
e.g. for helpful code completion.
